# Courseek

MIT Course Picker optimized for exploration and LLM text generation.

If you already know what courses you want, [hydrant](https://hydrant.mit.edu/) might be a better tool.

This is a one-off experiment. If you like it, please create/upvote a GitHub issue so I might find ways to merge with hydrant or maintain it for upcoming terms.
