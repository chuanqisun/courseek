We will present manifestations of these models in machine learning applications, from solving Go to multi-agent reinforcement learning, adversarial learning and broader multi-agent deep learning applications. We will discuss aspects of equilibrium computation and learning as well as the computational complexity of equilibria. We will also discuss how the different models and methods have allowed several recent breakthroughs in AI, including human- and superhuman-level agents for established games such as Go, Poker, Diplomacy, and Stratego.

Urban areas are significant contributors to carbon emissions due to factors like transportation, industry, and energy consumption. Therefore, addressing carbon emissions in cities is crucial for global efforts to combat climate change. In an urban social carbon economy, the course will focus on efforts to reduce carbon emissions and will explore methodologies to design solutions with a focus on social equity, community well-being, and inclusive development within urban contexts. \n\nThe course examines the intersections that enable individuals, communities, institutions, and corporations to take action by actively measuring, monitoring, and reducing their carbon emissions. By deepening in the understanding of the power of Artificial Intelligence and behavior change, which has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by one-third globally, the new carbon economy will create opportunities to accelerate the net-zero goals across all industries. Students will deepen their understanding of carbon avoidance and reduction products and infrastructure that leverage existing and new technologies like AI, sensor fusion, gamification, blockchain, and incentive systems that will power the new economy.","name":"Social Carbon Economy","inCharge":"Ramiro Almeida, Ryan Chin","virtualStatus":false,"rating":6.6,"hours":3.6,"size":13.0,"nonext":false,"repeat":true,"url":"","final":false,"half":false,"limited":false},"9.919":{"number":"9.919","course":"9","subject":"919","terms":["FA","SP"],"prereqs":"None","tba":false,"sectionKinds":[],"lectureSections":[],"recitationSections":[],"labSections":[],"designSections":[],"lectureRawSections":[],"recitationRawSections":[],"labRawSections":[],"designRawSections":[],"hassH":false,"hassA":false,"hassS":false,"hassE":false,"cih":false,"cihw":false,"rest":false,"lab":false,"partLab":false,"lectureUnits":0,"labUnits":0,"preparationUnits":0,"level":"G","isVariableUnits":true,"same":"","meets":"","description":"For teaching assistants in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, in cases where teaching assignment is approved for academic credit by the department.","name":"Teaching Brain and Cognitive Sciences","inCharge":"","virtualStatus":false,"rating":0,"hours":0,"size":0,"nonext":false,"repeat":true,"url":"","final":false,"half":false,"limited":false},"11.138":{"number":"11.138","course":"11","subject":"138","terms":["FA"],"prereqs":"None","sectionKinds":["lecture"],"lectureRawSections":["10-485/MW/0/2-3.30"],"lectureSections":[[[[16,3],[84,3]],"10-485"]],"tba":false,"hassH":false,"hassA":false,"hassS":true,"hassE":false,"cih":false,"cihw":false,"rest":false,"lab":false,"partLab":false,"lectureUnits":3,"labUnits":0,"preparationUnits":9,"level":"U","isVariableUnits":false,"same":"","meets":"11.458","description":"Investigates the use of social medial and digital technologies for planning and advocacy by working with actual planning and advocacy organizations to develop, implement, and evaluate prototype digital tools.

The course centers readings in genres of Indigenous futurisms to cover the basics of Indigenous water and energy planning. Through the lens of these genres, guest lectures, discussions, and case studies, students will understand the emergent trends in the development of traditional ecological knowledge. At the end of the course, students will propose speculative projects to scale community-based water planning interventions and initiatives towards utility scale to support the sovereignty and self-determination of Indigenous governments.","name":"Indigenous Water and Energy Planning: Emergent Futures in Scaling Traditional Ecological Knowledge","inCharge":"Janelle Knox-Hayes, Jean-Luc Pierite","virtualStatus":false,"rating":5.95,"hours":6.01,"size":11.8,"nonext":false,"repeat":true,"url":"","final":false,"half":2,"limited":false},"9.66":{"number":"9.66","course":"9","subject":"66","terms":["FA"],"prereqs":"6.3700/6.3800/9.40/18.05/6.3900/''permission of instructor''","sectionKinds":["lecture"],"lectureRawSections":["46-3002/TR/0/1-2.30"],"lectureSections":[[[[48,3],[116,3]],"46-3002"]],"tba":false,"hassH":false,"hassA":false,"hassS":false,"hassE":false,"cih":false,"cihw":false,"rest":false,"lab":false,"partLab":false,"lectureUnits":3,"labUnits":0,"preparationUnits":9,"level":"U","isVariableUnits":false,"same":"6.4120","meets":"9.660","description":"Introduction to computational theories of human cognition.

In an urban social carbon economy, the course will focus on efforts to reduce carbon emissions and will explore methodologies to design solutions with a focus on social equity, community well-being, and inclusive development within urban contexts. \n\nThe course examines the intersections that enable individuals, communities, institutions, and corporations to take action by actively measuring, monitoring, and reducing their carbon emissions. By deepening in the understanding of the power of Artificial Intelligence and behavior change, which has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by one-third globally, the new carbon economy will create opportunities to accelerate the net-zero goals across all industries.
